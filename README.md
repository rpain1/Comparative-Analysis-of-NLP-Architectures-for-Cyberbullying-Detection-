# Comparative Analysis of NLP Architectures for Cyberbullying Detection and Classification Across Social Media and Online Gaming Platforms

Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various deep learning models for detecting cyberbullying in text and audio data. The models include GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). These models were developed to understand the context and nuances of language used in cyberbullying, showcasing different strengths in processing and classifying data.

Models Description

GRU-Based Model: Utilizes GRU layers to handle sequential text data effectively, capturing the temporal dependencies within the data.

CNN-Based Model: Employs convolutional layers to extract features from static text, optimized for performance with lower computational demands.

BERT-Based Model: Leverages a pre-trained BERT model to achieve high accuracy through deep bidirectional understanding of language context. Capable of processing unknown text data and audio files accurately.
